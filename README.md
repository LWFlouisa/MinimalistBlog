# MinimalistBlog
Blogging software that doesn't worry about Javascript, Postgres, and any of that other nonsense. Just write a post in Nano, and it automatically creates your blog page and RSS Feed. Eventually going to implement a chatbot function, that outputs the whimsical statements of a chatbot, and some generated poetry.
